# Next Generation Citation Manager

Using simple command line scripts written in Python, we implement a simple
citation management system. 

We assume we have one or more `*.bib` BibTeX files as input, we process
these files and (eventually) create individual TiddlyWiki tiddlers for
each reference and/or author.
