crossref:
  comment: |
    This field holds an entry key for the cross-referencing feature. Child 
    entries with a crossref field inherit data from the parent entry 
    specified in the crossref field. If the number of child entries 
    referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, the 
    parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it has 
    not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the 
    mincrossrefs package option from § 3.1.2.1. Style authors should note 
    that whether or not the crossref fields of the child entries are 
    defined on the Biblatex level depends on the availability of the parent 
    entry. If the parent entry is available, the crossref fields of the 
    child entries will be defined. If not, the child entries still inherit 
    the data from the parent entry but their crossref fields will be 
    undefined. Whether the parent entry is added to the bibliography 
    implicitly because of the threshold or explicitly because it has been 
    cited does not matter. See also the xref field in this section as well 
    as § 2.4.1.

gender:
  comment: |
    The gender of the author or the gender of the editor, if there is no 
    author. The following identifiers are supported: sf (feminine singular, 
    a single female name), sm (masculine singular, a single male name), sn 
    (neuter singular, a single neuter name), pf (feminine plural, a list of 
    female names), pm (masculine plural, a list of male names), pn (neuter 
    plural, a list of neuter names), pp (plural, a mixed gender list of 
    names). This information is only required by special bibliography and 
    citation styles and only in certain languages. For example, a citation 
    style may replace recurrent author names with a term such as ‘idem’. If 
    the Latin word is used, as is custom in English and French, there is no 
    need to specify the gender. In German publications, however, such key 
    terms are usually given in German and in this case they are 
    gender-sensitive.

    citation keys but have legacy documents which use older keys for the

indexsorttitle:
  comment: |
    The title used when sorting the index. In contrast to indextitle, this 
    field is used for sorting only. The printed title in the index is the 
    indextitle or the title field. This field may be useful if the title 
    contains special characters or commands which interfere with the 
    sorting of the index. Consider this example:<pre>
    
        title          = {The \LaTeX\ Companion},
        indextitle     = {\LaTeX\ Companion, The},
        indexsorttitle = {LATEX Companion},
    
    </pre>Style authors should note that Biblatex automatically copies 
    the value of either the indextitle or the title field to 
    indexsorttitle if the latter field is undefined.

langid:

    The language id of the bibliography entry. The alias hyphenation is

    used to switch hyphenation patterns and localize strings in the 
    bibliography. Note that the language names are case sensitive. The 
    languages currently supported by this package are given in table 2. 
    Note that babel treats the identifier english as an alias for british 
    or american, depending on the babel version. The Biblatex package 
    always treats it as an alias for american. It is preferable to use the 
    language identifiers american and british (babel) or a language 
    specific option to specify a language variant (polyglossia, using the 
    langidopts field) to avoid any possible confusion. Compare language in 
    § 2.2.2.

    This field is the first item the sorting routine considers when sorting 
    the bibliography, hence it may be used to arrange the entries in 
    groups. This may be useful when creating subdivided bibliographies with 
    the bibliography filters. Please refer to § 3.5 for further details. 
    Also see § 4.5.5. This field is consumed by the backend processing and 
    does not appear in the .bbl.

xdata:

    This field inherits data from one or more @xdata entries. Conceptually,

    logical parent/child relation without inheriting data; xdata inherits 
    data without establishing a relation. The value of the xdata may be a

xref:
  comment: |
    This field is an alternative cross-referencing mechanism. It differs 
    from crossref in that the child entry will not inherit any data from 
    the parent entry specified in the xref field. If the number of child 
    entries referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, 
    the parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it 
    has not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the 
    mincrossrefs package option from § 3.1.2.1. Style authors should note 
    that whether or not the xref fields of the child entries are defined on 
    the Biblatex level depends on the availability of the parent entry. If 
    the parent entry is available, the xref fields of the child entries 
    will be defined. If not, their xref fields will be undefined. Whether 
    the parent entry is added to the bibliography implicitly because of the 
    threshold or explicitly because it has been cited does not matter. See 
    also the crossref field in this section as well as § 2.4.1.
