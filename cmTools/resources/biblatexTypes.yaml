bibnote:
  comment: |
    This special entry type is not meant to be used in the bib file like 
    other types. It is provided for third-party packages like notes2bib 
    which merge notes into the bib- liography. The notes should go into the 
    note field. Be advised that the @bibnote type is not related to the 
    \defbibnote command in any way. \defbibnote is for adding comments at 
    the beginning or the end of the bibliography, whereas the @bibnote type 
    is meant for packages which render endnotes as bibliography entries.

suppbook:
  comment: |
    Supplemental material in a @book. This type is closely related to the 
    @inbook entry type. While @inbook is primarily intended for a part of a 
    book with its own title (e. g., a single essay in a collection of 
    essays by the same author), this type is provided for elements such as 
    prefaces, introductions, forewords, afterwords, etc. which often have a 
    generic title only. Style guides may require such items to be formatted 
    differently from other @inbook items. The standard styles will treat 
    this entry type as an alias for @inbook.

suppperiodical:
  comment: |
    Supplemental material in a @periodical. This type is similar to 
    @suppbook but related to the @periodical entry type. The role of this 
    entry type may be more obvious if you bear in mind that the @article 
    type could also be called @inperiodical. This type may be useful when 
    referring to items such as regular columns, obituaries, letters to the 
    editor, etc. which only have a generic title. Style guides may require 
    such items to be formatted differently from articles in the strict 
    sense of the word. The standard styles will treat this entry type as an 
    alias for @article.

techreport:
  comment: |
    Similar to @report except that the type field is optional and defaults 
    to the localized term ‘technical report’. You may still use the type 
    field to override that.
