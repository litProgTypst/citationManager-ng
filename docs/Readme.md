# Design

# Goals

1. We want tools to collect new references and translate them into
   TiddlyWiki Tiddlers.

2. We want tools to, given a list of references required for a given
   paper, extract the references from our tiddler format and creates a
   BibTeX or the Typst Hayagriva YAML File Format for use with Typst.

3. (Eventually) generate a static external website of our references.
